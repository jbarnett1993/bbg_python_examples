1) New registration process
	Applications that use the Bloomberg Terminal API need to have a strong name.
	Public key token for applcation must be registered with Bloomberg.
	BlpApi.Register() no longer accepts appId string - instead public key token is extracted and verified.

	Once application is built with a strong name its publick key token have to be registered with Bloomberg.
	To get the public key token for application run the following command: 
		"%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\bin\sn.exe" -T <assemblyPath>
		Or on a 64 bit machine:
		"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\bin\sn.exe" -T <assemblyPath>	
		
2) Remote Terminal API support
	BlpApi.RegisterRemote() call added allowing a subset of Terminal API functionality to work across machine bounaries.
	This enables client applications using Terminal API to run on a different machine than the Bloomberg terminal.
	There are some requirements/restrictions including that client application must run under same user account as the Bloomberg terminal and remote usage of components in not supported.

3) Enhanced component group support and notifications
	New API calls added to allow applications to get component group security context and receive notifications about component group security context changes.
